# zero-to-app Design System

When working with UI components, theming, or layout in this React Native project:
- Read zero-to-app/README.md for the complete component API
- All UI components are exported from 'zero-to-app'
- Wrap app root with <ZeroToApp brand={createBrand({...})}> for theme and brand context
- Brand configuration is REQUIRED - all values (name, colors, fontSizes, spacing, borderRadius) must be provided when calling createBrand()
- Optional brand config: logo, footerLinks, navigation - if not provided, those components won't show links/items
- No default brand values exist - apps must provide complete brand configuration at app level
- Best practice: Create brand config in a shared file (e.g., app/brand.ts) and import it in layout files
- Brand is stable at runtime - created once, doesn't change during app execution
- Use useBrand() hook to access brand values (colors, spacing, fonts, navigation, footerLinks, etc.) in components
- Use ThemeContext for dynamic theme colors
- Never import brand directly - always use useBrand() hook inside components
- For StyleSheet.create() that needs brand values, use inline styles instead (StyleSheet.create runs at module level and can't use hooks)
- Navigation items are configured via brand.navigation.items - components (AppbarWeb, MobileMenuDrawer, mobile tabs) automatically use them
- Navigation icons: use web (Feather) for web platform, mobile (SF Symbols for iOS, Feather for Android) for mobile platforms
